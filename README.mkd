A Yii app for experimenting with complex grid views
----

The app has a SongController with two actions:

* /index.php?r=song/songs
* /index.php?r=song/reviews

song/reviews is fully implemented with sorting, filtering and gridview paging

**I implemented four ways of loading the Genre(Has Many relation) data:**

1. *Review::search()* - You group the primary/foreign keys of Review, and set together to true. You don't select any data from Genre, because its lazy loaded for each row.
2. *Review::search2()* - Same as above, but you select a GROUP_CONCAT of the data from Genre. Most efficient eager loading.
3. *Review::search3()* - Using classMap you import a custom CActiveFinder that enhances the eager loading magic of Yii. Easiest, but the disadvantage is that is does another 2 COUNT queries for the pager to work.
4. *Song::search()* - Related data is loaded in a keen fashion. Using KeenActiveDataProvider, the related models are loaded in a seperate query and then put into the relation properties of the earlier loaded models.
